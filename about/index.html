	<strong>The Government has given us the advice to wash our hands as frequently as possible at every opportunity. But there is a massive oversight in the STEM community when it comes to the biggest issues in preventing the spread.</strong> We have all experienced on multiple occasions in our lives where a soap dispenser in public or at work is empty. If someone enters your business, hospital or police station and are carrying COVID-19 and are unable to cleanse their hands there is a massive risk in spreading the virus to new victims. An empty dispenser becomes a touch point everyone will touch because they think they are doing the right thing. If its empty however all it is doing is increasing the spread of COVID-19 between the masses. GelAlert prevents this risk by alerting everyone when its running low before its empty. This way the container should run out and keep everyone in the business with clean, safe hands. Its no good being alerted when we run out. We need to be alerted beforehand.

    <p style=" text-align: left;"> 
How did you find coming up with your project idea? Was it quick and easy or did you need to think for a long time? <br><br> 

Coming up with my idea for the GelAlert took a good hour of brainstorming. I got the idea when thinking about, and asking the community things that annoy them most when they are outside during lock down. I wanted my idea to be original and useful particularly during lock down. I ended up deciding on a simple problem commonly faced inside places such as hospitals. They have closed-view hand sanitiser pumps which are frequently empty, most people believe “its not my job” and thus don’t report or fill up the hand sanitization pump, leaving it empty for the next person. If someone was carrying the virus this means that everyone after then to try the empty station gets the virus. This can potentially lead to risking peoples lives through something intended to be useful.

How did you manage your time throughout the week? <br> <br> 

Day 1 was spent sorting through ideas, resources and allocating time to see when I had for the project.<br> 

Day 2 was spent planning the device blueprints and final design and setting up advertising for the product.<br> 

Day 3 was spent constructing the device while also creating Logos and other media waiting for things like glue to dry.<br> 

Day 4 was spent on Advertising, minor final touches to my product, and making sure my project was completely finished to a 100% standard for Day 5.<br> 
<br> <br> 


What was the biggest challenge to you personally?<br> <br> 

The biggest challenge I faced was the limited amount of items and time I had to create the product. I ended up using lollipop sticks to create the actual device as they are easy to cut and glue together, are a bad conductor of heat and electricity, and have the right physical properties for what I am building other than the amount of friction when wet. I had to settle with this though for the prototype. <br> 
 
Time was also an issue because I had to juggle other activities outside and inside the house leaving little time for the competition. I could have done with another week to get things fully completed.
<br> <br> 




Have you learned anything new about STEM from the competition?<br> <br> 

I have personally enjoyed watching the videos on the site learning about peoples jobs and their contributions towards STEM, while also learning key things about future careers such as Engineering.
<br> <br> 



How did what you learn during the week help you with the project? What is the most interesting thing you learned?<br> <br> 

Personally I enjoyed learning about the STEM behind the live events for London 2012 found at <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/about/outreach/resources/stem_enterprise/rh_olympics.mp4"/> this link </a>because giant events like the Olympics require a lot of preparation and planning with a really positive and visible impact at the end whilst putting your brain to the test.
<br> <br> 
Are you now considering a future career in STEM?<br> <br> 

I really enjoy the engineering behind products so I wish to work more hand on in the future whilst also using my digital skills.
<br> <br>

How does the V1.0 work? <br> <br>

The version 1 movel was inspired by a ballcock found in a toilet. It works by floaing up on a hinge as the water rises. Our deisgn works like a plunger that floats on the sanitiser and goes down with it over usage. Our plunger hits a piece of metal on a lip of the device before it hits the bottom causing the ciruit to be completed, lighting up the LED or buzzer. We tried two other methods beforehand but struggled with both. The first idea involved a NOT gate on a loop on a circuit inside the Sanitiser because water conducts electricity. We had the problem of the conductivity of the hand sanitiser which led us to scrap the idea, and also the limit of parts to build a NOT gate (We would need a PNP or an NPN, which can be built with a LED and a LDR). The second design included a hinge almost exactly the same as a ballcock but working in reverse. This time we where limited by space inside the dispenser as we didn't want the alarm to go off too soon (before the level hits 25%). This idea worked the best excluding the friction of wet wood. The next design will be made of recycled plastic to ensure faster production and longer reliability. <br> <br>

Did you create everything yourself? <br> <br>

My ideas, logo and website where created myself by hand without the use of an online tool which does the work for you. This website took about 14 hours of coding and comes in at over 1000 lines of code despite not looking too exciting. The source code can be found on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/GelAlert/gelalert.github.io"> https://github.com/GelAlert/gelalert.github.io </a> <br> <br>

What is your marketing strategy?<br> <br>

Our marketing strategy includes highlighting the risks of standard soap dispensers to the public on our twitter page <a href="twitter.com/GelAlert/"> (twitter.com/GelAlert) </a> using the trendy animations seen. We are also looking at working our product to retailers who naturally want to sell our product for profit and will help with the advertising on their sites. Our product aims to sell more copies to people through retailers than the public directly. <br> <br>
